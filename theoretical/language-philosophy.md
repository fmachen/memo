## php

[official php manual preface](php.net/manual/en/preface.php)

```
PHP, which stands for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor" 
is a widely-used Open Source general-purpose scripting language 
that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML. 
Its syntax draws upon C, Java, and Perl, and is easy to learn. 
The main goal of the language is to allow web developers to write dynamically generated web pages quickly, 
but you can do much more with PHP. 
```

Personal summary: It's a glue language in order to aggregate others languages.

## python

resumed by [PEP-20](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)

```
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

easter egg: `>>> import this`

## ruby

Yukihiro Matsumoto:

```
I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive, and to enjoy programming, and to be happy. 
That is the primary purpose of Ruby language.

Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. 
They think, "By doing this, the machine will run fast. 
By doing this, the machine will run more effectively. 
By doing this, the machine will something something something." 
They are focusing on machines. 
But in fact we need to focus on humans, 
on how humans care about doing programming or operating the application of the machines. 
We are the masters. They are the slaves.

Everyone has an individual background. 
Someone may come from Python, someone else may come from Perl, and they may be surprised by different aspects of the language.
Then they come up to me and say, 
'I was surprised by this feature of the language, so Ruby violates the principle of least surprise.' 
Wait. Wait. The principle of least surprise is not for you only. 
The principle of least surprise means principle of least my surprise. 
And it means the principle of least surprise after you learn Ruby very well. 
For example, I was a C++ programmer before I started designing Ruby. 
I programmed in C++ exclusively for two or three years. 
And after two years of C++ programming, it still surprises me.
```
